# [short-color-names](//chrisnager.github.io/short-color-names)

CSS color names that are as short as or shorter than their corresponding hexcodes.

Feel free to use these color names in production because they have just as many or less characters in their color names than they have in their hexcodes.



## For example:

- The CSS color name `red` has three characters while it's hexcode `#f00` has four characters.
- The CSS color name `indigo` has six characters while it's hexcode `#4b0082` has seven characters.
- The CSS color name `crimson` has seven characters while it's hexcode `#dc143c` also has seven characters.
